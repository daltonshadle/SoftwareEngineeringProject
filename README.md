Hey Terry,

Everything should run when you pull it except you will have to set up the database on your computer. In our database class, at the top of the file there is a string where you can put the databse connection string. Also if the project is in a shared drive you will have to move the database to your local drive. This is because the SQL CE that comes with visual studios doesn't allow for connections to a shared drive.

Other than that, have fun grading!

Best,
